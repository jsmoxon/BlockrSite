(Sorry for this.)
<br/><br/>

Steve Jobs called the personal computer a bicycle for the mind. The Internet is a motorcycle; it's faster, but more dangerous. We have more articles, images, videos and ideas available to us than stars in the sky. And it's all available, right now, instantly. There is a conversation happening in our world that was not possible 10 years ago. Recently, I've had to ask myself, "Are you participating or eavesdropping?"
<br/><br/>
The Internet is a tool for producing and consuming. The danger of the Internet is that the default mode is for consumption rather than production. For years, I thought I was learning by being up to date with every article on Slate, NYT, The Atlantic, TNR, etc. It turns out I would have been better served following ESPN just as religiously. I could have at least brought up that knowledge in the workplace. 
<br/><br/>

I built Blockr to be a guideline and as a warmup tool.
<br/><br/>

I became a vegetarian because of my concerns about the environmental impact of eating meat, but I fell in love with vegetarianism because it gave me a guideline. Guidelines make us mindful. Guidelines, done well, are one of the most valuable tools of organized religion. Guidelines are rails that give you pause. Blockr is a guideline. Sure, you can disable it at anytime. But you're definitely going to have to think about it when you do. You'll stop and think, "Why is it okay to violate this guideline? What is important here?" If you have a good answer, then you can disable Blockr in peace. If not, it may gnaw at you a bit. That's not a bad thing. 
<br/><br/>

The goal of Blockr is to provide a nudge towards producing, no matter how humbly, before I consume. To be a part of the dialogue you need to speak up. I encourage people to post material inspired by Blockr onto blogs or other public forums though that isn't necessary. 
<br/><br/>

I also use Blockr as a warm up tool. I got inspired by Stephen Elliot's Daily Rumpus emails. Reading Elliot was the first time I realized that one could warmup one's brain. Like any athlete you can't expect to run out right away and do your best work. It's helpful to warmup a bit. Calling it a warmup takes the pressure off of it. For many, uninterrupted time to just sit and think is nearly impossible to find. I have used Blockr to carve out that time. Because of the onslaught of glowing rectangles, I find i'm almost never sitting devoted to a single task entirely. When I'm working I've got several tasks in front of me and the threat of the Internet to distract me. Even when I'm walking somewhere my mind is under siege by my phone, my ruminating mind, the billboards and faces on the street. Writing in the morning before checking the Internet is one of the only times I get to sit and focus on a single task all day.
